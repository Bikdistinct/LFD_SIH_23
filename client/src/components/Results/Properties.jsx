          Aloe vera is a popular medicinal plant with antioxidant and
          antibacterial properties. It may be useful for reducing dental plaque,
          accelerating wound healing, preventing wrinkles, and managing blood
          sugar, among other benefits.

            The cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries use aloe vera
            extensively, and the plant has an estimated annual market value of
            $13 billionTrusted Source globally. Aloe vera is known for its
            thick, pointed, and fleshy green leaves, which may grow to about
            12–19 inches (30–50 centimeters) in length. Each leaf contains a
            slimy tissue that stores water, and this makes the leaves thick.
            This water filled tissue is the “gel” that people associate with
            aloe vera products. The gel contains most of the beneficial
            bioactive compounds in the plant, including vitamins, minerals,
            amino acids, and antioxidants.
